# üåæ Smart Wheat Farming AI System

## üìù Overview
This project, **Smart Wheat Farming AI System**, was developed by AI students at **Esprit School of Engineering** as part of an academic project.  
It leverages artificial intelligence to tackle key agricultural challenges related to wheat farming in Tunisia.  
The work is divided into six main axes:
- Disease Detection (Classification & Detection)
- Pest Detection
- Weed Detection
- Production Quality Assessment
- Plant Growth Monitoring
- Soil Quality Analysis

This project is hosted on GitHub using **GitHub Education tools** and aims to support sustainable agriculture through intelligent technologies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Deep learning models for plant disease classification and detection.
- Object detection models for pests and weeds.
- Computer vision-based growth stage monitoring.
- Quality assessment metrics for wheat production.
- Soil data analysis using machine learning.
- Modular and scalable design for future agricultural extensions.

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend
- React.js 
- HTML5 / CSS 

### üíª Backend
- Python (main AI logic)
- FastAPI or Flask (for serving models as APIs)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation and prototyping)

### üõ†Ô∏è Other Tools
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for AI model training)
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing and analysis)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)
- GitHub Education (free hosting, tools like Heroku, Namecheap)
- Google Colab (for training experiments)
- LabelImg / Roboflow (for dataset labeling)

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Disease Detection**     | Identifying fungal and bacterial infections                   |
| **Pest Detection**        | Detection of wheat-eating insects                             |
| **Weed Detection**        | Identifying weed regions                                      |
| **Production Quality**    | Detecting crop health status                      |
| **Growth Monitoring**     | Time-series analysis of wheat growth                          |
| **Soil Quality**          | Classification models based on pH, moisture, and nutrients via satellite/drone images |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Model Access
To keep the repository lightweight and manageable, each contributor has hosted their pre-trained models on their own Google Drive.
üîó You‚Äôll find a dedicated Google Drive link in each module‚Äôs folder or README file. Simply follow the link to download and use the model associated with that specific axis.

This approach ensures modularity and keeps the repository clean.
